== Welcome to GoodTeacher

This is a side project to keep RoR skills up to date. Just kinda hacking away. Hope to build something to help teachers collaborate.

Have fun looking around. Some of the neater parts that were new to me are using full nested slugged urls and my polymorphic comments controller.

If you have any comments on how I've set stuff up please let me know. Would love a good code review, as I know I'm pretty weak. =)
